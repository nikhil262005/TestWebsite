# Museum to Mausoleum - Digital Design Portfolio

This is a website for a digital graphic designer with an elegant vintage aesthetic, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML structure
- `css/styles.css`: Styling for the website based on the design specifications
- `css/fonts.css`: Font definitions and loading handling
- `js/script.js`: JavaScript for interactions and smooth scrolling
- `Design.json`: Original design specifications
- `fonts/`: Directory for custom fonts

## Design Details

The website follows an "elegant-vintage" aesthetic with a sophisticated mood. The color palette consists of:

- Primary: #b19cd9 (lavender purple)
- Secondary: #8b7c8b (muted mauve)
- Background: #e8e4d9 (light beige)
- Accent: #d4c4d4 (light lilac)

Typography uses:

- "Le Jour Serif" for main headings and hero section
- "Darker Grotesque" for navigation elements
- "Playfair Display" for body text and fallbacks

## Font Information

The website uses two special fonts:

1. **Le Jour Serif** for the main heading and subtitle.

   - The font is already installed in the project.

2. **Darker Grotesque** for the navigation links.
   - This font is loaded from Google Fonts.

If the fonts are not available, the site will automatically fall back to suitable alternatives.

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the website.

1. Replace the placeholder text in the sections
2. Add your own images and portfolio items
